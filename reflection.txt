During this project, we learned how to use APIs (specifically the Spotify Web API), 
how to use the ‘Spotipy’ library, got a refresher on Python, learned about the authorization flow, 
how to use Flask, and integration with Heroku. We enjoyed developing our algorithm for finding songs 
based on the user’s input, learning how to use the ‘Spotipy’ library, and collaborating with each other as a team. 
The initial learning curve for figuring out how to use an API was very challenging, 
as well as figuring out how to do user authentication using OAuth. One of our group members 
also took on the task of learning Flask, so the new skill was a bit difficult for her to pick up on at first, 
but there are many resources online that she found useful, such as the official documentation as well as YouTube tutorials. 
We found the IPL to be extremely helpful for our learning and progress during this project, 
since our TA, Jordan, was knowledgeable about Spotipy and the Spotify API. 
His help allowed us to implement OAuth and to discover the Spotipy library which was critical to our project.
