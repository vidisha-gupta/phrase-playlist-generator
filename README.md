<!-- Write a user guide for your project in the form of a file called README.txt or README.md (if you prefer Markdown) at least several paragraphs in length. Though the structure of your user guide is entirely up to you, it should be clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation: be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

The guide should also include a link to a short video (no more than 5 minutes long) that presents your project to the world with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. Your video should somehow include your project title, your names, and any other details that youâ€™d like to convey to viewers. We recommend recording a video through Zoom for ease of screensharing and so that all collaborators can present. -->
